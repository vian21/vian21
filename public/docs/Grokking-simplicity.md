# Gokking Simplicity - Functional programming

## Types of functions

1. Pure functions

- Always return the same result given the same input
- Dont depend or modify a global state

2. Impure fuctions i.e Actions

- Sending an email
- delete/ changing data in a database

- Always prefer the use of pure functions for functional programming
- if a function is doing more than one thing split it into multiple functions
-
