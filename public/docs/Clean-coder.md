# Clean architecture

## Testing - Test Driven Development (TDD)

3 fundamental laws

1. Write just one test that fails
2. Write only code that makes the test pass
3.

## Dependecy injection

- your code should not rely on a specific framework or database
- Funvtions should not use or modify global variables but instead pass them as parameters and return a value instead of modifying global variables
